# PostToolUse → audit.jsonl writer (system-developer plugin, v1.0.0+).
# Reads CC hook stdin JSON (tool_name, tool_input, tool_use_id, duration_ms,
# effort.level, session_id) and appends one row to .context/logs/audit.jsonl
# with actor "system-developer:hook:audit-tooluse".
#
# ADVISORY ROW: system-developer agents run as subagents under an orchestrating plugin.
# When the orchestrator's own hooks are active, its rows are authoritative
# and these are advisory — the shared metadata.dedupe_key ("<session_id>:
# <tool_use_id>") lets the orchestrator's audit-dedup hook reconcile the two. When
# system-developer runs standalone, these rows stand alone.
#
# Self-test: pass --self-test to feed a synthetic fixture and assert schema.

# ---------- Advisory de-duplication ----------
# Every installed dev plugin registers its own copy of this hook, and all of them
# fire on the same event, so a single tool call landed in audit.jsonl six times
# (twelve for subagent-stop, which fires twice per stop). In one five-hour run
# that was 2,265 of 2,837 rows — 80% of the audit trail — and every reader
# (refine-branch-target.sh, publish-pl-issue.sh, the retrospective) paid to parse
# all of it.
#
# metadata.dedupe_key was already present and already identical across all
# copies; nothing consulted it. The header above promises "the orchestrator's
# audit-dedup hook" will reconcile these rows, but no such hook exists. Reconcile
# here instead: if this key is already on record, this row adds nothing.
#
# A tail window, not a full scan: the duplicate copies fire within milliseconds
# of each other, so the key is always near the end, and a whole-file grep would
# grow linearly with a log that reaches thousands of rows in a single run.
#
# The canonical (orchestrator) row is never suppressed by this — it is written by
# a different hook that carries no advisory flag and performs no such check.
